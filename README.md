# JavaSyntax

This module 2 homework is meant for you to practice the basic Java you've learned this week.

Before you get started, pull, make a branch for yourself, and make a fork of this repository so you can commit and push your changes! 
* **note** It is best Git practice to make small, frequent commits rather than waiting until you're all done with your work. Practice this now! When you're working on this, make commits
    * when you're confident you've gotten one part right
    * when you've finished working on your code for now and are putting it down
    * when you've gotten something down you don't want to lose!!

There are three parts for you to complete, described here. 

When you are finished with your work, you can submit a pull request to the main repository. 

## Fixing Errors
Open the file *src/com/spider/FixingErrors.java*. You'll see a class with several compile-time and run-time errors. Find and fix them, and push your fixes. 

## Array Sorting
In the file *src/com/spider/SyntaxMain.java* which is your main function, you'll see the array *myArray* defined. Use your Java knowledge to sort the contents of myArray from smallest to largest, starting on line 9. The loop on line 13 will print out the contents of myArray, so you can check your work. 

## String manipulation
Below your array sorting, a string is defined. Use the same Java rules to print out the text of the string backwards. 

You may use a StringTokenizer to separate the words in the string to reverse them, or you can use native String functions to reverse the String. 
* **hint** Strings are, in some ways, special arrays!
